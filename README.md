Status: ongoing.
This project uses two APIs: A geolocation API that retrieves the longitude and latitude of the city, and a weather API that retrieves the temperature. Both API's work together like this: the weather API will use the information from the geo API to display the temperature. This was my first project where I utilized an API. Because of that, I relied on a Youtube tutorial for the same project. 

Upcoming ideas:
To make this program more personalized, I will have the program call the API to display the UV index. The user will then be able to see what SPF of sunscreen they should put on based on the current UV. This will make the program a useful tool. 

Finally, I will implement a GUI to give the program a more visual aspect.
